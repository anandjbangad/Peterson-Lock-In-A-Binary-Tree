Instructions for running the code

Locks(WholeProject) contains all file
I was still confused on the previous assignment comment of sending whole project. Just avoiding the risk I am sending src and 
bin both files. I will clarify it and wont repeat it next time

1) If running Test2.java
use the following command for q3 
java Test2 BinaryTreePetersonLock 16
if you specify the argument it takes the number of thread counts. If you do not mention the thread counts it by default takes 8

Use the following code for q4
java Test2 LExclusion


2) If running Test.java
then you have to ensure the thread_count is 2 for peterson,lockone,locktwo
for filter for different threads you can change the number of threads.
